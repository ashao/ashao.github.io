Background
----------

I am a computational scientist who specializes in combining AI/ML techniques
with HPC-scale scientific simulations. I have a specific background in
oceanography, the development of coupled models used for climate and weather,
and numerical methods and techniques. Over the course of my career, I have
contributed to a number of open-source projects including the MOM6 and NEMO
ocean models, the CanESM5 coupled climate model, and HPE's SmartSim library.

The most fulfilling part of having worked on these projects is building a
network of forward-thinking, creative collaborators at places like NOAA/GFDL,
IPSL, the UK Met Office, the M2Lines initiative, NREL, TU Dresden, TU Darmstadt.
Together we have advanced numerical techniques and applied AI techniques that
reexamine the ways we formulate and use HPC simulations.

To get away from staring at screens, I am part of the Lohbrunner Community Farm
Cooperative. I serve as a board member and also participate in a group that
focuses on subsistence farming. I'm also a fan of theatre and music with formal
training in voice and violin. Having a background in performance means that I
find public speaking an exciting opportunity to tell stories and find ways of
connecting people through ideas.
