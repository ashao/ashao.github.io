Background
----------

I am a computational scientist who specializes in combining AI/ML techniques
with HPC-scale scientific simulations. I have a specific background in
oceanography, the development of coupled models used for climate and weather,
and numerical methods and techniques.

To get away from staring at screens, I am part of the Lohbrunner Community Farm
Cooperative. I serve as a board member and also participate in a group that
focuses on subsistence farming. I'm also a fan of theatre and music with formal
training in voice and violin.
