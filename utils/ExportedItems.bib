	abstract = {We demonstrate the first climate-scale, numerical ocean simulations improved through distributed, online inference of Deep Neural Networks (DNN) using SmartSim. SmartSim is a library dedicated to enabling online analysis and Machine Learning (ML) for high performance, numerical simulations. In this paper, we detail the SmartSim architecture and provide benchmarks including online inference with a shared ML model, EKE-ResNet, on heterogeneous HPC systems. We demonstrate the capability of SmartSim by using it to run a 12-member ensemble of global-scale, high-resolution ocean simulations, each spanning 19 compute nodes, all communicating with the same ML architecture at each simulation timestep. In total, 970 billion inferences are collectively served by running the ensemble for a total of 120 simulated years. The inferences are used to predict the oceanic eddy kinetic energy (EKE), which is a variable that is used to tune different turbulence closures in the model and thus directly affects the simulation. The root-mean-square of the error in EKE (as compared to an eddy-resolving simulation) is 20\% lower when using the ML-prediction than the previous state of the art. This demonstration is an example of how machine learning methods can be integrated into traditional numerical simulations, replace prognostic equations, and preserve overall simulation stability without significantly affecting the time to solution.},

	abstract = {We document the configuration and emergent simulation features from the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory (GFDL) OM4.0 ocean/sea ice model. OM4 serves as the ocean/sea ice component for the GFDL climate and Earth system models. It is also used for climate science research and is contributing to the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project version 6 Ocean Model Intercomparison Project. The ocean component of OM4 uses version 6 of the Modular Ocean Model and the sea ice component uses version 2 of the Sea Ice Simulator, which have identical horizontal grid layouts (Arakawa C-grid). We follow the Coordinated Ocean-sea ice Reference Experiments protocol to assess simulation quality across a broad suite of climate-relevant features. We present results from two versions differing by horizontal grid spacing and physical parameterizations: OM4p5 has nominal 0.5° spacing and includes mesoscale eddy parameterizations and OM4p25 has nominal 0.25° spacing with no mesoscale eddy parameterization. Modular Ocean Model version 6 makes use of a vertical Lagrangian-remap algorithm that enables general vertical coordinates. We show that use of a hybrid depth-isopycnal coordinate reduces the middepth ocean warming drift commonly found in pure z* vertical coordinate ocean models. To test the need for the mesoscale eddy parameterization used in OM4p5, we examine the results from a simulation that removes the eddy parameterization. The water mass structure and model drift are physically degraded relative to OM4p5, thus supporting the key role for a mesoscale closure at this resolution.},
