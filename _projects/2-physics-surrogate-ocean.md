title: "Online, neural network inference for sub grid-scale physics"
excerpt: "Neural networks trained on high-resolution data can 'learn' the relationships between the mean flow state variables and the turbulent terms. With scientists at NCAR and M2Lines, we have demonstrated the first implementations of using these neural networks online in climate-scale, ocean simulations. The image below is from a simulation performed on Frontier which we subseqently scaled to ~20,000 CPUs and ~5,000 AMD GPUs. <br/><img src='/images/gz21_online.png'>"
