title: "Neural networks for accelerating numerics"
excerpt: "Numerical methods are often limited by a CFL condition that limits the ability to take long timesteps. In collaboration with scientists at GFDL, we are investigating ways of using neural networks to predict 'unroll' a timeloop for a finite volume model and predict fluxes over multiple timesteps at once. In this way, we are mimicking a multi-dimensional, high CFL algorithm while still maintaining properties of conservation.
