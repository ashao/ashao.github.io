Abstract
========

AI is a powerful tool that promises to solve some of the hardest problems in
science. These advancements can be further leveraged to tackle problems of
global societal importance including climate change and resilience, improving
the efficiency of green technologies, and more efficient control schemes for
complex systems. Like any other tool, the deployment of these AI-based solutions
requires careful consideration especially when considering the validation of
these AI techniques, the reproducibility of the results, and the verifiability
of correctness. This presentation gives an overview on how global organizations,
academia, and industry are addressing these problems and provides some examples
of promising areas where AI is being leveraged for scientific advancement.
