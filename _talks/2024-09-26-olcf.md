Abstract
========

SmartSim is a workflow library that makes it easier to use common Machine
Learning (ML) libraries, like PyTorch and TensorFlow, in High Performance
Computing (HPC) simulations and applications. This allows the launching of ML
infrastructure on HPC systems alongside user workloads. SmartSim also allows ML
to be written in Python, while still interfacing with Fortran, C, and C++
applications at HPC scale. In this training, an overview of SmartSim and best
practices will be provided, along with specific examples of how to use it on
Frontier (OLCF) and Perlmutter (NERSC).
